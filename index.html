                <h2>BEGINNING</h2>
                <p>
                    Vercingetorix rallied the many tribes of Gaul to set a revolt against the Roman Empire. When Caesar heard of this news he quickly rushed to prevent this by setting
                    up defences to counter the Gallic forces. Caesar lead men to capture supples from the Gallic Army which led Vercingetorix to fall back. As this was happening
                    Vercingetorix had a sudden realisation that it was still winter, and that the Romans were quickly running low on supplies. He didn't attack the Romans but awaited
                    their starvation throughout the cold winter. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Caesar's hands were tied so he decided to attack the Gallic forces head on, and besieged the area that Vercingetorix
                    fled back to. Vercingetorix wanted to flee but the warriors were unwilling to leave. The Gauls built strong defensive
                    fortifications and continuously attacked the Roman parties. However not even their defences and the cold winter could stop the Roman Army, who eventually
                    attacked and looted the Gaul camp. Vercingetorix fled back to his home tribe capital, which he was most eager to defend.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Romans attacked the capital but were
                    defeated due to being greatly outnumbered. Caesar fell back and Vercingetorix attracted many new tribes to help in his cause. Vercingetorix took all these tribes and
                    marched towards Caesar to intercept him before he could make it back to Rome. The two armies met but Caesar won the battle, causing Vercingetorix to flee once more.

                <p>
                    Vercingetorix fled back to Alesia, knowing an assault on Caesar would not work this time. When Caesar got to Alesia, he decided to play Vercingetorix's own game,
                    and started to beseiged Alesia, and try to starve them out. Over the span of 1 month, the Romans had built fortications 25 miles long, including trenches, moats, 
                    towers and traps. While the Romans were in the process of the construction, Vercingetorix had his men sent out to disrupt the constructions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Vercingetorix sent Gaul messengers to try and get the remainder of Gaul tribes to come to Alesia and war the Romans. Caesar found out about this and constructed even
                    more fortifications. This lessened the Roman forces due to how far some of the had to go to get the wood. The Gauls attacked the fortifications due to the reduced
                    Romans, which made Caesar make even more traps to catch or kill the Gauls.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Since Alesia held up to 80,000 population, it did not take long for their food supples to run out. The Gauls got together and decided that the old and sick should
                    leave. The wives and children were also sent out in the hope to save rations and that Caesar would take them captive and feed them. Caesar denied this, and the 
                    Vercingetorix left the people out to starve to death.
