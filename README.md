- ### Design
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The two main colours used in this project are dark grey and white.
  - #### Typography
    - The font used for the Headings of this website is 'Bebas Neue' since it is quite bold and sharp which suits the topic of the website. The font used in the body of the website is 'Lato' since it is very clean and easy to read, especially with longer paragraphs of informational text. Both used 'Sans Serif' as a fallback font incase the other two fonts don't load.
  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is incredibly informational and powerful when it comes to historical topics, since we need visual help on understanding how things would/could have looked back then. The website shows many powerful images of the main people involved in the battle, as well as some famous paintings of the events. Images are used beside informational text to further enhance the users imagation when learning.

## Features
  - #### Navigation Bar
    - Added features to the navigation bar such as the active page being underlined and if mouse is hovering over another page it will also be highlighted by an underline. This 
    allows the user to know which page they are currently on, as well as visual aid of what page they will be going onto next if they click.

  - #### Footer
    - Added social media links and icons to the footer. All links open in a new tab. This is an easy and visually pleasing way to have users gain access to your social media pages.
    The icons make the aesthetic of the page nicer, rather than have words or links to click.

  - #### Scroll Feature
    - Added scroll feature for the first section on the main page. When clicked it will scroll down to the next section. The allows users, especially on mobile to quickly navigate
    the opening slides, since the opening slide don't have much text, rather a brief introduction followed by powerful images.

  - #### Forms
    - Added forms section for contact and feedback sections. Added required feature to the contact form. The contact form allows users to send us their personal details, such as

  - #### Responsiveness
    - Website is responsive to all screen sizes. For example, on mobile the nav bar is activated through the use of the burger icon. The text is still overlayed on certain images, so the user still experiences the visual aspects of the site. for longer text, the images shortly follow the text, to allow users to visualise what they have just read.

## Credits

 past the section.
