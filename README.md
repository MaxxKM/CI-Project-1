- ### Design
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The two main colours used in this project are dark grey and white.
  - #### Typography
    - The font used for the Headings of this website is 'Bebas Neue' since it is quite bold and sharp which suits the topic of the website. The font used in the body of the website is 'Lato' since it is very clean and easy to read, especially with longer paragraphs of informational text. Both used 'Sans Serif' as a fallback font incase the other two fonts don't load.
  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is incredibly informational and powerful when it comes to historical topics, since we need visual help on understanding how things would/could have looked back then. The website shows many powerful images of the main people involved in the battle, as well as some famous paintings of the events. Images are used beside informational text to further enhance the users imagation when learning.
